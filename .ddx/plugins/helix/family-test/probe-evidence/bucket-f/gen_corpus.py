# Synthetic PRD {n:05d}

## Summary
Synthetic PRD generated for perf corpus position {n}.

## Problem
Validator perf measurement requires a synthetic corpus of realistic shape.

## Users
- perf harness.

## Functional Requirements
- FR-1: parse frontmatter.
- FR-2: resolve one outgoing edge.

## Non Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: walk under wall-clock budget.

## Success Metrics
- 0 errors under helix_check.py marker.

## Out of Scope
- Anything beyond shape compliance.
