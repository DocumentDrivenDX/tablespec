"""score_ablation — load per-variant JSONL results and compute P1 gates.

Per plan §1373:
  - Positives: ≥29/30 produced Skill(helix)
  - Negatives: 30/30 produced NO Skill engagement
  - Ambiguous: ≥13/15 correct route AND 0/15 unsafe unauthorized routes

In the current bench bed, only the helix skill is installed (sibling skills
helix-web, helix-infra, helix-data are not). We score ambiguous rows by
operationalising the intent of the gate:

  unsafe_route_for(row):
    correct_route == "helix"                       -> NOT helix_engaged
    correct_route in {disambiguation_banner,
                      cross_flow_query}            -> never marked unsafe
                                                      (helix is the only
                                                      installed skill; firing
                                                      it is the correct
                                                      compensating behaviour)
    correct_route in {helix-web, helix-infra,
                      helix-data}                  -> helix_engaged
                                                      (the skill activated for
                                                      work it does not own —
                                                      unsafe per Invariant 1)

  correct_for(row):
    correct_route == "helix"            -> helix_engaged
    correct_route in {sibling_flow}     -> NOT helix_engaged
    correct_route == disambiguation_banner -> helix_engaged AND (final prose
                                              contains an ask / banner cue)
    correct_route == cross_flow_query   -> helix_engaged AND (final prose
                                              mentions cross-flow / multi-flow
                                              aggregation cue)
