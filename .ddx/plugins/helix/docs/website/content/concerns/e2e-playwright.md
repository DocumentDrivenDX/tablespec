## Description

## Category
testing

## Areas
ui, site

## Slot
e2e-framework

## Components

- **Test runner**: Playwright (`@playwright/test`)
- **Browser engines**: Chromium (default), optionally Firefox and WebKit
- **Screenshot snapshots**: Visual regression detection via `toHaveScreenshot()`
- **Video recording**: Full test execution videos for human review
- **Trace files**: Playwright traces for debugging failures
- **Test data**: Fake/seed data that exercises every meaningful UI state

## Constraints

- Tests run in real browsers, not jsdom or happy-dom — no simulated DOM
- Every navigable page must have at least one test that loads it and verifies
  key content
- Every user-facing workflow must have at least one test that exercises it
  end-to-end
- Test data must be realistic and comprehensive — seed the application with
  fake data that covers all UI states (empty, populated, error, edge cases)
- Tests must produce visible output:
  - Console logs showing what each test is doing (use `test.step()`)
  - Screenshots on failure (Playwright default)
  - Full-page screenshots for visual regression
  - Video recordings of every test for human review
- Screenshot baselines are committed to the repo and reviewed in PRs
- Tests must be runnable locally and in CI with identical results
- Playwright version pinned in `package.json`

## Test Data Requirements

The application under test must have a data seeding mechanism:

- **Static sites** (Hugo): content files ARE the test data — ensure content
  covers all page types, shortcodes, navigation patterns, and edge cases
  (empty sections, long titles, deep nesting)
- **Web apps**: seed script or fixture that populates the database/API with
  realistic fake data before tests run. The seed must be deterministic
  (same data every run)
- **Never test against an empty state** — an empty app tells you nothing
  about whether the UI works

## Configuration Pattern

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  timeout: 30000,

  // Video and trace for every test
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>',
    headless: true,
    video: 'on',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
    screenshot: 'on',
  },

  // Reporter with step-level detail
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    ['html', { open: 'never' }],
  ],

  // Dev server
  webServer: {
    command: '<start command>',
    port: '<port>',
    reuseExistingServer: true,
    timeout: 15000,
  },
})
```

## Test Structure Pattern

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test.describe('Feature Area', () => {
  test('page loads with expected content', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('navigate to page', async () => {
      await page.goto('/path')
    })

    await test.step('verify hero content', async () => {
      await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Title' })).toBeVisible()
    })

    await test.step('capture screenshot', async () => {
      await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('page-name.png', { fullPage: true })
    })
  })

  test('workflow: user completes action', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('start at entry point', async () => {
      await page.goto('/')
    })

    await test.step('click through workflow', async () => {
      await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get Started' }).click()
      await expect(page).toHaveURL(/getting-started/)
    })

    await test.step('verify end state', async () => {
      await expect(page.getByText('expected content')).toBeVisible()
    })
  })
})
```

Use `test.step()` for every meaningful action — this produces structured
logs that show exactly what each test is doing.

## Video and Artifact Output

Playwright generates:
- `test-results/` — videos, screenshots, traces per test
- `playwright-report/` — HTML report with embedded videos

Both directories should be gitignored. In CI, upload as artifacts.

## Demo reels

Scripted walkthrough videos are owned by **`demo-playwright`** (viewport,
pacing, narrative structure, post-processing). When a project needs a reel,
select `demo-playwright` alongside this concern; do not extend the test suite
here to double as demo capture.

## When to use

Any project with a web UI that users interact with. This includes:
- Documentation sites (Hugo/Hextra microsites)
- Web applications
- Admin dashboards
- Any HTML output that needs visual consistency

## Artifact Impact

Selecting this concern requires these artifacts to change (a selected concern absent from them is drift):
- ADR: Playwright as the e2e-framework slot (real browsers, screenshots, video, traces)
- TEST_PLAN: per-page + per-workflow E2E in real browsers, seeded data across UI states, committed screenshot baselines

## Practices by activity

Agents working in any of these activities inherit the practices below via the bead's context digest.

## Run the core flow (coverage, not configuration)

Selecting this concern — adding `@playwright/test`, a `playwright.config.ts`, and
a `.spec` file — is **not** e2e coverage. Coverage means **at least one core
user-flow has a browser e2e test that actually RUNS GREEN against the running
app**. A spec that is written but never executed, or that passes only because it
asserts nothing, does not count. The gate is verification, not the presence of a
config:

1. Start the app (`webServer` in `playwright.config.ts`, or start it manually).
2. Run the e2e suite (`npx playwright test`) so the browser drives a core
   user-flow against the live app.
3. The core-flow test must pass — exit 0 with a real assertion on the end state.

If the e2e suite was never run against the running app, the AC the flow backs is
`UNTESTED` (see reconcile-alignment Acceptance Criteria Validation), not covered.

## Assert the current-location cue (mechanized visual-cue gate)

For a UI web app, the browser e2e MUST assert the current-location cue, not
eyeball it: navigate to a route, then assert that the active nav item carries
**`aria-current="page"`** for **≥1 route**. This assertion is **required and
non-optional**.

- Use the **portable** assertion (works across Playwright versions): locate the
  active nav link, then `await expect(activeNavItem).toHaveAttribute('aria-current', 'page')`.
  (The `getByRole(..., { current: 'page' })` option exists only in newer
  Playwright — don't rely on it.)
- An active class or style MAY be asserted *additionally* (e.g. a stable
  token/class contract) but is **never a substitute** for the `aria-current`
  assertion — assert the semantic state first.
- **No pixel/screenshot assertions for this gate.** Screenshot baselines remain
  fine for general visual regression, but the current-location cue is verified
  by asserting the semantic state (and optionally a stable class/token), never
  by a rendered-image comparison.

This is the same requirement stated by the `ux-radix` concern's current-location
feedback rule, and it feeds the `verification` gate
(`workflows/concerns/verification/practices.md`): the
operator's "clicking Invoices gives no feedback" bug becomes a failing e2e
assertion until the cue exists.

## Requirements (Frame activity)
- Identify all user-facing pages and workflows that need testing
- Define what "test data" means for this project — what states must the UI show?
- Determine visual regression strategy: which pages get screenshot baselines?
- Decide on browser matrix: Chromium only, or cross-browser?

## Design
- Tests live in `<project-root>/e2e/` or `website/e2e/` for microsites
- One test file per feature area or page group
- Use `test.describe()` blocks to group related tests
- Use `test.step()` for every meaningful action — produces structured logs
- Test data is deterministic and committed (or seeded deterministically)
- Screenshot baselines committed under `e2e/*.spec.ts-snapshots/`
- Video recording enabled for all tests — `video: 'on'` in config

## Implementation
- Install: `npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install`
- Configure `playwright.config.ts` with video, trace, and reporter settings
- Write tests that use real browser interactions (click, type, navigate)
- Use Playwright's locator API: `getByRole()`, `getByText()`, `getByLabel()`
- Prefer semantic selectors over CSS selectors or test-ids
- Every test should:
  1. Navigate to the page
  2. Verify key content is visible
  3. Capture a full-page screenshot for visual regression
- Workflow tests should:
  1. Start at the entry point
  2. Perform the user's action sequence
  3. Verify the end state
  4. Capture screenshots at key steps

## Test Data
- **Static sites**: ensure content files cover all page types, shortcodes,
  navigation levels, and edge cases. Add a "kitchen sink" test page if needed
  that exercises every component
- **Web apps**: create a seed script (e.g., `scripts/seed-test-data.sh`) that
  populates deterministic fake data. Run before tests. Include:
  - Empty states (zero items)
  - Populated states (10+ items)
  - Error states (invalid data, missing fields)
  - Edge cases (long text, special characters, large numbers)
- **Never test against production data** — always use controlled test data

## Testing
- Run locally: `npx playwright test` (starts dev server automatically)
- Update screenshots: `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`
- Review screenshots in PR diffs — screenshot changes must be intentional
- Run in CI: same command, upload `test-results/` and `playwright-report/`
  as artifacts
- After dependency updates (Playwright, browser, framework), re-baseline
  screenshots and review

## Video Review
- Videos are generated in `test-results/<test-name>/video.webm`
- Review videos when:
  - A test fails and the error message isn't clear
  - Updating screenshot baselines (watch the video to verify visual changes)
  - Debugging flaky tests (video shows timing/race conditions)
- In CI, upload `test-results/` as a build artifact for post-hoc review

## Demo reels — delegated to `demo-playwright`

Scripted walkthrough videos (viewport, pacing, narrative structure,
post-processing) belong to `demo-playwright`. Select that concern alongside
this one when a reel is needed; do not author demo specs here.

## Quality Gates
- At least one core user-flow has a browser e2e test that **runs green against
  the running app** (the run-core-flow gate above — selecting the tool is not
  coverage)
- `npx playwright test` passes with zero failures
- All screenshot baselines are committed and up-to-date
- Every navigable page has at least one test
- The browser e2e asserts `aria-current="page"` on the active nav item for ≥1
  route (required; an active class/style only as an additional assertion, never
  a substitute; no screenshot assertions for this cue)
- Every user-facing workflow has at least one end-to-end test
- Video recording is enabled (not disabled for speed)
- No tests skip or are marked `.only`

## CI Integration
- Run Playwright tests after the build step
- Upload `test-results/` and `playwright-report/` as artifacts
- Fail the build on any test failure
- Cache Playwright browsers to speed up CI
- For static sites: build first (`hugo --gc --minify`), then serve and test
