This concern owns **how a slice of state is persisted as truth** — the decision
to store the full, ordered sequence of state-changing **events** in an
append-only log and treat that log as the authoritative system of record,
deriving current state by **replaying** it. It owns the event store, replay /
rehydration, snapshots, projections/read models, idempotent application, and
event schema evolution. It does **not** own what the domain model is, how the
codebase layers itself, or how messages move between systems. Four neighbors
must stay distinct:

- **`domain-driven-design`** owns **what** is modeled — the aggregates, value
  objects, invariants, and ubiquitous language, and the fact that an aggregate
  **emits domain events** when something meaningful happens. Event sourcing is
  one way to **persist** those emitted events *as the source of truth* and
  rehydrate the aggregate from them. Compose: the aggregate root is still the
  invariant gatekeeper (DDD's rule), and command handling still loads → mutates
  → persists one aggregate per transaction; ES only changes *how* that
  aggregate is loaded and saved (replay an eventstream, append new events). Do
  **not** restate aggregate/invariant rules here — reference DDD.
- **`enterprise-integration-patterns`** owns moving messages **between** systems
  or bounded contexts (channels, routers, transformation, delivery). A **stored
  domain event is not an integration message**: ES is a persistence/state model
  **within** one context; EIP is the transport across contexts. One can publish
  the other (an event handler may emit an integration event onto a channel), but
  the eventstream that is the source of truth and the wire message that fans out
  to other systems are different artifacts. Reference EIP for the transport; do
  not own it.
- **`onion-architecture`** owns **how** the codebase layers and which way
  dependencies point. The **event store is an outer-ring infrastructure
  adapter** that implements a persistence interface (an event-store / repository
  port) declared by an inner layer in domain terms. ES says *the log is the
  truth and the aggregate rehydrates from it*; onion says *the inner ring
  declares the port and the outer ring implements it*. Do not restate the
  dependency rule — reference onion for the arrangement.
- **`sample-data`** owns the seed/demo dataset. For an event-sourced slice the
  governed seed is expressed as **events appended to the store** (not rows
  inserted into a current-state table), so projections rehydrate from a
  realistic event history; ES defines that the seed is events, `sample-data`
  governs the dataset's variety and edge cases.

**CQRS is the frequent companion, not owned here.** Event sourcing pairs
naturally with **CQRS** — the write side appends events; the read side serves
queries from projections built off the eventstream. This concern owns the
**event log as source of truth and its projections**; it does **not** own the
full command/query segregation discipline. Name CQRS as the companion; do not
claim to define it.

## Components

- **Event** — an immutable record of something that **happened**, named in the
  past tense (`SeatsReserved`, `OrderCanceled`, `EmailOpened`), carrying the
  data and **business intent** of the change. Intent-focused events
  (`TwoSeatsReserved`) are worth more than state-snapshot events
  (`RemainingSeatsChanged to 42`) — the latter degrade the store to a meaningless
  change log.
- **Event store** — the append-only log that is the **system of record / source
  of truth**. Each entity has its own ordered **eventstream**; the store
  supports append + read-by-stream and, ideally, optimistic-concurrency append.
  (It is *not* a message broker — Kafka et al. fan events out but lack
  per-entity stream reads and optimistic concurrency; see Drift Signals.)
- **Rehydration (replay)** — deriving an entity's current state by **replaying
  its eventstream** from the start (or from a snapshot) and applying each event
  in order. Current state is **derived, never the stored authority**.
- **Snapshot** — a serialized cache of an entity's state at a point in its
  stream, taken every *N* events, so rehydration loads the latest snapshot and
  replays only the tail. A snapshot is an **optimization, not the truth** — it
  is always regenerable from the eventstream.
- **Projection / read model (materialized view)** — a read-optimized view built
  by an event handler consuming the stream. It is **disposable and rebuildable
  from the event log alone**; there is no editing a projection in place — a
  change means replaying from event zero forward. This is the CQRS read side.
- **Event handler / consumer** — listens for events and updates a projection,
  triggers a side effect, or publishes an integration event. Delivery is
  typically **at-least-once**, so handlers must be **idempotent**.
- **Compensating event** — the *only* way to "undo" or correct: append a new
  event that reverses a prior one (`ReservationCanceled` compensating
  `SeatsReserved`). The original event stays; history records the reversal.
- **Event version + upcaster** — a version identifier on each event and a
  transformation that converts an older event schema to the current one **during
  deserialization on replay**, leaving stored events unchanged.

## Constraints

### The event log is the source of truth — stored events are immutable and append-only

- The event store is the **authoritative system of record**. State changes are
  recorded **only** by appending a new event; stored events are **never updated
  or deleted in place**.
- **Current state is derived by replaying events, not stored as the authority.**
  Any current-state representation (in memory, a row, a cache) is a *derived
  view* that can be discarded and rebuilt from the log.
- A correction or reversal is a **new compensating event appended** to the
  stream, never an edit of the offending event. (In-place rewrite of stored
  events undermines the audit trail and is a last-resort migration only.)

### This is not a plain audit log — the log IS the state

- In a plain CRUD-plus-audit system, current state lives in a table and the log
  is a **side record** of what happened. In event sourcing the relationship is
  inverted: the **log is the primary store and current state is the side
  view** derived from it. There is no authoritative current-state table behind
  the log.

### Projections are derived, rebuildable, and eventually consistent

- Every projection / read model is **rebuildable from the event log alone** —
  delete it and replay the stream to reconstruct it. Nothing of record lives
  only in a projection.
- Projections are **eventually consistent** with the write side: there is a
  delay between appending an event and a projection reflecting it. The system
  (and its consumers) must be designed to tolerate that window; ES does not offer
  read-your-write consistency across the projection boundary.

### Event application is idempotent; events are ordered and versioned

- Event handlers / projection updates are **idempotent** — processing the same
  event twice yields the same state and fires a side effect at most once
  (track the last processed sequence number, or design naturally-repeatable
  mutations). At-least-once delivery makes this mandatory, not optional.
- Per-entity event **order** is significant and preserved; concurrent appends to
  one stream are arbitrated by **optimistic concurrency** (reject-on-conflict,
  reload, retry), not by overwriting.
- Each event carries a **version**; schema evolution is handled by **upcasting**
  older versions to the current one on replay (and/or tolerant deserialization
  for additive changes), so application code handles only the latest shape while
  stored events stay immutable.

### Personal data vs. immutability

- The append-only, immutable store conflicts with deletion mandates (right to be
  forgotten). Design for it: keep personal data **outside** the eventstream
  referenced by id (delete independently), or **crypto-shred** (per-subject key,
  delete the key). Do not plan to delete events to satisfy erasure.

## Drift Signals (anti-patterns to reject in review)

- A stored event is updated or deleted in place to "fix" or change state →
  immutability violation; append a **compensating event** instead
- Current state persisted as the authority with the events kept only as a side
  audit log → that is CRUD-plus-audit, **not** event sourcing; if ES is selected,
  the log must be the source of truth
- A snapshot (or cache) treated as the authority / not regenerable from the
  stream → snapshot is an optimization; the eventstream remains the truth
- A projection holding data of record that cannot be rebuilt by replaying the
  log → make the projection fully rebuildable from events; nothing of record
  lives only in a read model
- Editing a projection in place to "correct" it instead of replaying → rebuild
  the projection from event zero
- Event handler that is not idempotent (double-applies on redelivery, fires a
  side effect twice) → make application idempotent (sequence tracking / safe
  mutations)
- Events with no version and no upcasting path → add a version + upcaster so
  schema can evolve without rewriting stored events
- State-snapshot events (`XChangedTo42`) instead of intent events
  (`TwoSeatsReserved`) → capture business intent, not just the resulting value
- A message broker (Kafka, …) used as the event store → use a real event store
  for the per-entity stream-of-record + optimistic concurrency; the broker is a
  distribution layer, not the system of record
- Event sourcing applied to thin reference/lookup CRUD with no history
  requirement → over-engineering; use current-state storage (see When to use)

## When to use

Select for the **slice(s) of a domain where the sequence of changes is itself
valuable** — where audit/history is a hard requirement, temporal queries
("state as of date X", "how did we get here") matter, or the change stream *is*
the product: **ledgers and financial transactions, order/booking lifecycles,
activity timelines, and lead/engagement event streams** (e.g. a per-lead
timeline ingesting open / click / bounce events is a strong fit — the events are
the asset). It also fits when you must avoid conflicting updates under high write
contention, or when the app already emits events naturally.

It is a **non-exclusive, composable** concern (no slot) and is **scoped per
domain slice, not whole-product** — apply it to the parts that benefit (the
payment ledger, the order pipeline) and use plain current-state storage
elsewhere; "don't event-source everything." `areas: data` scopes its practices
to data-layer work items. Compose with `domain-driven-design` (aggregates emit
the events ES persists), `onion-architecture` (the event store is an outer-ring
adapter behind an inner port), **CQRS** (the projections are the read side), and
`sample-data` (the seed is events appended to the store).

Do **NOT** select it for **thin CRUD / forms-over-data with no history
requirement**, mostly-static reference or lookup data (catalogs, config),
prototypes / short-lived tools where the schema-evolution and projection
investment never pays back, systems that require strong read-your-write
consistency and real-time views (projections are eventually consistent), or
teams with no event-driven experience adopting it blind. There, current-state
storage is the simpler, correct choice (KISS/YAGNI).

## Artifact Impact

Selecting this concern requires these artifacts to change (a selected concern absent from them is drift):
- ADR: event-sourcing for the named slice + event store + snapshot/upcasting + eventual-consistency window
- TD: event store, rehydration/replay, projections/read-models, idempotent handlers, upcasters
- DATA_DESIGN: append-only eventstream as system of record; projections are rebuildable views
- TEST_PLAN: replay rebuilds state; idempotent handler (no double-apply); compensating-event correction

## ADR References

Record an ADR when selecting event sourcing for a given domain slice (it is a
costly-to-reverse persistence decision), naming the slice, the
audit/history/temporal justification, the event store choice, the
snapshot/upcasting strategy, and the projections and their eventual-consistency
window.

## Practices by activity

Agents working in any of these activities inherit the practices below via the bead's context digest.

These practices govern **persisting a slice of state as an append-only log of
events that is the source of truth**, deriving current state by replay. They do
**not** govern what the domain model is (`domain-driven-design`), how the code
layers (`onion-architecture`), or how messages move between systems
(`enterprise-integration-patterns`). When a rule references the aggregate, defer
to DDD for the modeling; this concern asserts how that aggregate is persisted
and rehydrated. Apply these **per domain slice** that selected event sourcing —
not to every entity in the product.

## Decide the slice before applying

- Confirm the slice **earns** event sourcing: a hard audit/history requirement,
  temporal queries, value-bearing change streams (ledger, lifecycle, activity /
  engagement timeline), or high write-contention conflict avoidance. If it is
  thin CRUD with no history need, mostly-static reference data, or a short-lived
  prototype, do **not** event-source it — use current-state storage (record the
  decision; "don't event-source everything").
- Name the **aggregate / entity** whose eventstream this is (its boundary is the
  DDD aggregate's — defer to `domain-driven-design`), the **event store**, the
  **projections** to build, and the **eventual-consistency window** consumers
  must tolerate. Record the selection in an ADR.

## Model events as immutable, intent-bearing facts

- Events are **named in the past tense** and capture **business intent**, not
  just a resulting value: `TwoSeatsReserved` / `OrderCanceled`, MUST NOT be
  `RemainingSeatsChangedTo42`. State-snapshot events reduce the store to a
  meaningless change log.
- An event, once appended, is **immutable**: its data MUST NOT be updated or its
  record deleted. (Schema *shape* may evolve via versioning/upcasting — that does
  not mutate stored events; see below.)
- Each event carries a **version** identifier (in the envelope or the type name)
  so consumers can select handling logic and upcasters can transform it.

## Append-only store as the source of truth

- The event store is the **authoritative system of record**. A state change is
  recorded **only** by **appending** a new event — never by an in-place
  update/delete of a stored event.
- **Current state is derived by replaying events, not stored as the authority.**
  Do NOT keep an authoritative current-state table behind the log; any
  current-state representation is a derived, disposable view.
- To undo or correct, **append a compensating event** (`ReservationCanceled`
  compensating `SeatsReserved`); the original event stays. In-place rewrite of
  stored events is a last-resort migration only, recorded as an ADR deviation —
  not a routine correction.
- Per-entity event **order** is preserved; concurrent appends to one stream are
  arbitrated by **optimistic concurrency** (reject-on-conflict → reload →
  reevaluate → retry), never by overwriting.

## Rehydrate from the stream; snapshot only as a cache

- Derive an entity's current state by **replaying its eventstream** in order and
  applying each event. The command path is: load (replay) → run business logic
  on the aggregate → append new events.
- Where replay cost is material, take a **snapshot** every *N* events and
  rehydrate from the latest snapshot + the tail of events after it. A snapshot
  is an **optimization, not the truth** — it MUST be regenerable from the
  eventstream, and the eventstream remains authoritative.

## Build projections that are rebuildable and idempotent

- Every projection / read model is **rebuildable from the event log alone** —
  deleting it and replaying the stream reconstructs it. Nothing of record lives
  **only** in a projection.
- Do **not** edit a projection in place to correct it; a change to a projection
  means **replaying from event zero forward**.
- Projection updates / event handlers are **idempotent** — at-least-once
  delivery means the same event can arrive twice; processing a duplicate MUST
  yield the same state and fire any side effect at most once. Track the last
  processed sequence number per consumer, or design inherently repeatable
  mutations.
- Treat projections as **eventually consistent** with the write side; design the
  UI/consumers for the lag. Do not assume read-your-write across the projection
  boundary.

## Evolve event schema by versioning + upcasting

- Handle schema evolution **without mutating stored events**:
  - **Tolerant deserialization** for additive, non-breaking changes (ignore
    unknown fields, default missing ones).
  - **Upcasting** for breaking changes — a transform from an older version to the
    current one applied **on replay/deserialization**, chainable so application
    code handles only the latest shape. Stored events stay unchanged.
- In-place migration (rewriting stored events to the new schema) breaks
  immutability and the audit trail — last resort, ADR-recorded.

## Handle personal data under immutability

- Plan erasure up front: keep personal data **outside** the eventstream
  (referenced by id, deletable independently) or **crypto-shred** (per-subject
  key, delete the key). Do NOT plan to delete events to satisfy a
  right-to-be-forgotten request.

## Boundary with neighbors

See `concern.md` for the canonical Boundary (vs `domain-driven-design`,
`enterprise-integration-patterns`, `onion-architecture`, `sample-data`, and
the **CQRS** companion). Idempotent application of events here is the same
property `enterprise-integration-patterns` requires of consumers under
at-least-once delivery — defer there for the channel-delivery rule, apply it
here to projection/read-model updates. The event store is a real event store
(per-entity stream reads + optimistic concurrency), not a message broker
standing in as the system of record.

## Quality Gates

- Stored events are **immutable and append-only** — verifiable that no code path
  performs an in-place update or delete of a stored event; corrections are
  compensating events.
- The **event log is the source of truth**: current state is **derived by
  replaying events**, not stored as the authority (no authoritative
  current-state table behind the log; snapshots are a cache, regenerable from the
  stream).
- **Projections are rebuildable from the event log alone** — deleting a
  projection and replaying reconstructs it; nothing of record lives only in a
  projection.
- **Event application is idempotent** (duplicate delivery yields the same state /
  at-most-once side effect) and **events carry a version** with an upcasting (or
  tolerant-deserialization) path so schema evolves without rewriting stored
  events.
- Per-entity event **order is preserved** and concurrent appends are arbitrated
  by **optimistic concurrency**, not overwrite.
- Projections are treated as **eventually consistent**; consumers tolerate the
  window (no read-your-write assumption across the projection boundary).
- Event sourcing is **scoped to the slice that earns it** (audit/history/temporal
  /value-bearing stream); thin-CRUD / static-reference slices use current-state
  storage instead.
