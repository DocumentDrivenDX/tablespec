How HELIX runs in a project: the activities, the artifact authority
hierarchy, the alignment skill, the build-exit gate, and the convergence
loop. For the
argument behind the procedure, see [the thesis](/why/the-thesis/) and
[principles](/why/principles/). For the activity catalog (each activity's
purpose and artifact types), see the
[activities glossary](/reference/glossary/activities/).

## The Double Helix

HELIX operates as two interleaved cycles that share the artifact graph:

- **Planning helix**: review, plan, validate. Creates and refines the
  artifacts that describe what should be true.
- **Execution helix**: apply, measure, report. Uses those artifacts to
  guide implementation, review outcomes, and feed new evidence back into
  planning.

The two cycles run concurrently. A human refines specs while an agent
builds features. The shared state is the artifact graph plus whatever
tracker, queue, or runtime your platform owns.

## Multi-Directional Workflow

Changes can enter at any activity. The same authority hierarchy
determines which artifact governs, regardless of entry point:

- **Top-down**: a vision revision propagates into PRD, features, designs,
  tests, code.
- **Bottom-up**: implementation reveals a missing requirement; the spec
  gets a refinement.
- **Middle-out**: a design exposes a conflict between two features; both
  specs update.
- **Lateral**: a deploy-time observability gap surfaces an ADR question.
- **From running systems**: unstructured feedback ("I don't like how this
  looks") routes to the layer it applies to.

The alignment skill keeps these flows coherent. It walks the artifacts
on demand, identifies drift in any direction, and produces a plan to
close it.

## Authority Hierarchy

When artifacts disagree, HELIX escalates to the higher-authority artifact:

1. **Product Vision**: what the product should become.
<!-- vale Helix.PassiveVoice = NO -->
2. **Product Requirements (PRD)**: what must be built.
<!-- vale Helix.PassiveVoice = YES -->
3. **Feature Specs / User Stories**: detailed behavior.
4. **Architecture / ADRs**: structural decisions.
5. **Solution / Technical Designs**: how to build it.
6. **Test Plans / Tests**: verification criteria.
7. **Implementation Plans**: build sequencing.
8. **Source Code**: current state, not source of truth.

Higher layers govern lower layers. Source code reflects what exists, not
what should exist. If a higher layer is missing, HELIX does not infer
intent from lower layers; the alignment skill flags the gap instead.

## Artifact Graph

The governing artifacts form a directed dependency graph:

```
Vision ──→ PRD ──→ Feature Specs ──→ Acceptance Criteria
                        │
                        ├──→ Technical Designs
                        │
                        └──→ Solution Designs
                                    │
ADRs ←── Cross-cutting Concerns ────┘
  │
  └──→ Context Digests ──→ Runtime Work Context
```

The graph enables impact analysis (which artifacts a change affects),
reconciliation (verifying dependent artifacts remain consistent), and
context synthesis (a runtime pulls the governance chain for a specific
change).

## The Alignment Skill

The portable HELIX skill operates the loop. Given the current artifacts
and (optionally) a new intent, it:

1. **Walks** the governing artifacts top-down through the authority
   hierarchy.
2. **Identifies** drift, gaps, and contradictions across activities.
3. **Produces** a plan describing the artifact updates needed to restore
   coherence, ordered by authority.

The plan is the output. A runtime (DDx, Databricks Genie, Claude Code,
anything that reads markdown) executes it, creating work items,
dispatching agents, and recording evidence. HELIX itself does not
execute work.

### When alignment produces an open question

The skill stops short of a plan when:

- Authority is missing (no governing artifact for the work).
- Existing documents cannot resolve the ambiguity.
- The work needs product judgment or prioritization.
- A decision requires stakeholder approval.

In these cases the plan flags the open question and waits. Humans
<!-- vale Helix.PassiveVoice = NO -->
answer at the right altitude; the loop resumes when authority is
<!-- vale Helix.PassiveVoice = YES -->
restored.

## How a Cycle Goes

A typical iteration:

1. **Intent enters** somewhere: a feature request, a metric flag, an
   incident, a refactor itch.
2. **Alignment runs** against current artifacts and produces a plan
   describing which activities the change affects.
3. **Runtime executes** the plan, creating concrete work items in
   whatever tracker the runtime provides.
4. **Artifacts update** as work happens: vision revisions, new feature
   specs, fresh ADRs, additional tests, code changes.
5. **Iterate captures** what happened: metrics, alignment reviews,
   improvement backlog.
6. **Intent enters again**, feeding the next pass.

The loop does not "finish." It runs continuously, with the alignment
skill catching drift before it accumulates and the runtime executing
work between alignment passes.

## Review and Alignment

After an agent completes work, an independent review (a different agent,
a different model, or a human) examines it against the artifact
hierarchy. Reviews ask three questions:

- Does the implementation match its spec?
- Does the spec still align with the PRD and vision?
- Do the [cross-cutting concerns](/use/workflow/concerns/) hold?

Review findings become artifact amendments, tracker work, or platform
tasks, and feed back into the planning helix. Nothing dead-ends at
"reviewed."

## Verification Exit Gate

Passing build, unit tests, and a happy-path end-to-end check is not
enough to exit the Build activity. The build-exit gate requires the
interface-appropriate harness to prove each acceptance criterion's
behavior:

- **Web**: Playwright or an equivalent browser harness.
- **HTTP API**: request and response checks against a running service.
- **CLI**: shell against the built binary.
- **TUI**: a terminal harness driving the real interactive tool.
- **Backend logic**: integration tests against real dependencies.

The gate guards against work that is locally green but globally
incomplete. It is the canonical exit condition for Build, not a
suggestion.

## Evolve Until Converged

Build does not stop at first-pass green. The evolve-until-converged
loop re-checks the work against its specs and concerns and iterates
until it converges:

1. Run the verification harnesses against each acceptance criterion.
2. If any criterion is not yet proven, route the gap back to the
   appropriate artifact or implementation step.
3. Re-run.

<!-- vale Helix.PassiveVoice = NO -->
The loop is bounded (a project configures a maximum number of
<!-- vale Helix.PassiveVoice = YES -->
iterations or a convergence tolerance), but the default is "go check
your work again," not "declare done as soon as the first set of tests
passes."
